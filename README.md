Development of data driven, sensor-based irrigation has become possible with recent advancements in technology, yet due to a cost-barrier to entry, equitable adoption remains out of reach. Therefore, a simple microcontroller based LoRa platform, Open_Irr, was developed in the Arduino IDE to record resistive measures of soil matric potential and automate irrigation events. A single Open_Irr Node may connect with ≤ 16 Watermark® soil sensors and manage 4 irrigation groups, with Node sampling frequency, irrigation settings, and radio transmission settings being end-user adjustable without programming knowledge. Multiple Nodes may connect with a single Gateway to provide a scale-neutral solution for irrigation automation.

Within the soils laboratory of the Appalachian Fruit Research Station the Open_Irr device is utilized for abiotic stress screening trials. Several experiments have been performed to automate water management in research activities.
